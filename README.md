# Emotion Detection of Text Using Machine Learning Models

A machine learning project for detecting emotions from raw text, using natural language processing and popular classification algorithms.  
This project demonstrates the application of ML for real-world sentiment and emotion analysis in texts—ideal for HR, customer support, social media, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Emotion Detection:** Recognizes various emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.
- **Modern ML Models:** Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and more.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Input text and get instant emotion predictions.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphs and charts to analyze dataset distribution and model performance.
- **Well-Documented Code:** Clear scripts and notebooks for easy understanding and extension.
- **Ready for Integration:** Results can be used in chatbots, feedback systems, and monitoring tools.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Customer Service:** Analyze user feedback and categorize support tickets by emotion.
- **HR Analytics:** Detect employee mood and engagement from surveys or chats.
- **Social Media Monitoring:** Track public sentiment for brands, products, or events.
- **Education:** Measure student emotional responses in online learning platforms.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alibalio/emotion-detection-ml.git
    cd emotion-detection-ml
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook for training and testing:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook EmotionDetection.ipynb
    ```

4. **(Optional) Run the web app:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    *(if a Flask or Streamlit app is included)*
